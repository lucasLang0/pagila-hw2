/*
 * Compute the total revenue for each film.
 * The output should include another new column "total revenue" that shows the sum of all the revenue of all previous films.

 * HINT:
 * My solution starts with the solution to problem 16 as a subquery.
 * Then I combine the SUM function with the OVER keyword to create a window function that computes the total.
 * You might find the following stackoverflow answer useful for figuring out the syntax:
